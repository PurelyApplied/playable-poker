This is a Perl script.
If you are using a Windows machine, you will need to download Perl.
It should be standard on any *nix or Mac machine.

Downloading Perl for Windows:
  I personally use Strawberry, which is available as a free download at strawberryperl.com.
  ( If you have any interest in programming, I would recommending getting the Padre.
    It runs off Strawberry, but provides a good Perl editor and allows easy execution of your scripts.
    It is available at padre.perlide.org. )

Running this script:
  Windows users should run win_poker.bat.
  This should open a terminal (cmd.exe) window and prompt for input.
  *nix and Mac users should either (1) navigate to the script in the shell and run from the command line,
     or (2) access the file, bring up the menu, and select "Run in Terminal."
  Additional information can be found within the program using `help` or `info` commands.

  The file `Ranking` must be in active directory for the program to execute.

  *nix users and (possibly) Mac users will enjoy additional coloring of reported data.
  This feature is not yet implemented for Windows users, due to cmd.exe incompatibilities.
